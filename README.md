This is a balancing robot platform to practice how to tune PIDs, how to work with Raspberry Pi and openCV. (for dummies by the dummies)

Most of sketches are not yet well-commented, but they are not very hard to comprehend. Although I'm planning to make some how-to videos, but a bit later.

Balancing robot is based on Joop Brokking's project http://www.brokking.net/yabr_main.html
Web app is based on Fredrik Gustafsson's project https://github.com/fregu856/Sommarprojekt16
Color tracking using PID is based on this article https://oscarliang.com/raspberry-pi-color-tracking-opencv-pid/
First algorithm of line detection is based on this medium article https://medium.com/@galen.ballew/opencv-lanedetection-419361364fc0
Second algorithm of line detection is based on this project https://github.com/CRM-UAM/VisionRace
Third algorithm of line detection is based on this project (there are also good videos on youtube, see Out of the BOTS) https://gist.github.com/flyboy74
